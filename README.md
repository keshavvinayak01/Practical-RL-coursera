## Reinforcement Learning algorithms


## My Implementations of the Reinforcement Learning algorithms from the Practical_Rl course from Coursera using TensorFlow



In the next few commits, i'll add implementations in PyTorch as well.


##### The following algorithms have been implemented in these notebooks:

###### Week 1:
1. Introduction to TensorFlow
2. Introduction to Gym
3. Cross-entropy method
4. Deep cross entropy method


###### Week 2:
1. Markov Decision Process

###### Week 3:
1. Q-Learning
2. Expected value SARSA
3. Q-Learning using experience replay 

###### Week 4:
1. Approximate Q-Learning
2. DQN on Atari: Breakout.

###### Week 5:
1. REINFORCE
2. Asynchronous Actor Critic method (A3C)
